# Chimkenz-Spreadsheets
Spreadsheet software from linux terminal with the specificity of using python syntax, for all of you spreadsheet enjoyers out there who don't belive EXCEL should be a programming language

Warning : this is made for people who have at least a little ammount of knowledge of python, not meant to be used by grandmas (no offence to grandmas tho)


with code from https://github.com/sandbuster2005/ChimkenMuziks


# How to use

1) USE MONOSPACE FONT!!!!!

2) Edit options directly in OPTIONS.txt but only change the second collumn to something that seems like it would work

3) Squares that dont begin by a = are considered str squares and will not execute anything inside of them

4) Squares that begin with a = have their values set by executing what is inside of them, replacing the square names by the value of set square (for example, a square could have its content be "=min(7,B1)")

5) The grid is limmited to go from A0 to ZZ999 (which should still be enough, its over 700,000 squares)

6) Never use ; inside of squares



# Pros Tips
Do NOT try to set the square UYUM9000 to something, things will break for several reasons
